A library that offers you three specific classes for vectors which are Vector1D, Vector3D, and Vector7D as the orientation component of Complex, Quaternion, and Octonion respectively while even higher dimensional Numbers lets you use Sedenion, Pathion, Chingon, Routon, Voudon, and so forth, that means it will make you feel better!
